    <h2>Beautiful place - Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p>One of the seven wonders of the world, Taj Mahal is located on the banks of River Yamuna in Agra.
         It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. 
        Constructed entirely out of white marble in the 17th century, Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful monuments in the world</p>
